This repository stores solutions and programs that generated those solutions to
Project Euler Problems. Many of these solutions were written hastily 
(viz. hack-y), and are not examples of good or clean code. 

Most of the problems were solved using either C++ or Java, and were selected
only for my preference for the language. The languages used were not selected
for any sort of runtime performance, or maintability reasons (viz. valid 
reasons).

The main purpose of this repository is simply to offer the way I went about
solving these interesing problems. 

Questions and comments are welcome. :)

Cheers.
